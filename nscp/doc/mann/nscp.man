[titledesc {NaviServer Control Port Guide}]

[description]

 This document describes the NaviServer control port interface
 provided by the nscp module. The control port offers a Tcl-based
 administration interface that allows you to connect to a designated
 host and port, and to perform server management and database
 operations while the server is running.


[section {Introduction}]

 NaviServer includes a control port interface that can be enabled by
 loading the nscp module. With this interface, you can use a telnet
 client to connect to a specific host and port and then administer the
 server and execute database commands in the running server.

[para]

 The control port interface is implemented in Tcl. Within the control
 port, you can execute virtually any Tcl command available in the Tcl
 libraries and ADP pagesâ€”with the exception of the commands requiring
 a connection thread (e.g. all subcommands of [cmd ns_conn] except
 [cmd "ns_conn isconnected"]).

[para]

 To effectively administer a server through the control port, ensure
 that:

 [list_begin itemized]
 [item] The nscp module is loaded.
 [item] The nsperm module is loaded to enforce proper permissions.
 [item]	Database services (including drivers and pools) are properly
 configured if you plan to execute database commands while the server is running.
 [list_end]


[section {COMMANDS}]

The [term nscp] module defines a single command:

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd "nscp users"]]

 Returns the list of usernames permitted to connect via the control port.

[list_end]


[section {Configuring the Control Port Interface}]

 Below is an example configuration that demonstrates how to enable and
 configure the control port. This example shows three configuration
 sections:

 [list_begin enum]
 [enum] The [term nscp] module is loaded in the [const /modules] section for [const {$server}].
 [enum]	The [const /module/nscp] section defines the control port parameters.
 [enum]	The [const /module/nscp/users] section defines the allowed users.
 [list_end]


[example_begin]
 #
 # Control port -- nscp
 #
 ns_section ns/server/${server}/module/nscp {
   ns_param   port            9999        ;# Control port listens on port 9999
   ns_param   address          127.0.0.1  ;# For security, use 127.0.0.1 only
   ns_param   echopasswd       off
   ns_param   cpcmdlogging     off
}
 
 # Control port users
 ns_section ns/server/${server}/module/nscp/users {
   #
   # The default password for nsadmin is "x". You should change it.
   # For example, type "ns_crypt /newpassword/ /salt/" and put the encrypted string
   # below.
   
   ns_param user "nsadmin:t2GqvvaiIUbF2:" ;# sample user="nsadmin", pw="x".
 }
 
 ns_section ns/server/${server}/modules {
   # ...
   ns_param nscp nscp.so
 }
[example_end]

[para]
Important points regarding this configuration:

[list_begin itemized]

[item]  The [option port] parameter defines the port that the interface will listen
     on. The default is 9999.


[item] The [option address] parameter defines the IP address to bind
       to. By default, this is set to [const 127.0.0.1] (or
       [const ::1] for IPv6), ensuring that only local connections are allowed.

[item] The [option echopasswd] parameter controls whether the password
       is echoed as it is typed; its default setting is off.

[item] The [option cpcmdlogging] parameter determines whether entered
       commands are logged in the system log; its default is off.

[item]  The [option user] parameter in the [const users] section
     defines users who can log into the control
     port. There are three semicolon-separated fields. The first is
     username (nsadmin); the second is a Unix-like password hash.  You
     can create a password by typing "ns_crypt /mypasswd/ /salt/".  As with
     Unix, only the first four characters are used.

configuration.


[section {Using the Control Port Interface}]

[para]
To use the control port interface, follow these steps:

[list_begin enum]

[enum] Connect via Telnet: Telnet to the IP address and port specified
       in the [const /module/nscp] section. For example:

[example_begin]
 telnet 127.0.0.1 9999
[example_end]

[para] Upon connecting, the session will display:

[example_begin]
 Trying 127.0.0.1...
 Connected to localhost.
 Escape character is '^]'.
 login:
[example_end]


[enum] Login:
   At the login prompt, enter a valid username as defined in the
   [const /module/nscp/users] section. For example:

[example_begin]
  login: nsadmin
[example_end]

The session will then prompt for a password:

[example_begin]
 password:
[example_end]

[enum] Enter Password: Type the password associated with the username
  (the default is "x"). If the credentials are correct, the session will
  display a welcome message similar to:

[example_begin]
 Welcome to SERVER running at /usr/local/ns/bin/nsd (pid NNNNNN)
 NaviServer/MAJOR.MINOR:PATCHLEVEL for linux built on MON/DAY/YEAR at HH:MM:SS

 SERVER:nscp 1>
[example_end]

[enum] Execute Commands: At the control port prompt, you can execute
  nearly any Tcl command available in NaviServer's Tcl libraries and
  ADP pages.

[enum] Exit: To log off from the control port, simply type [const exit].

[list_end]


[section {Useful Commands}]

Within the control port, type:

[example_begin]
 lsort [lb]info commands[rb]
[example_end]

to obtain a complete list of available commands. You can also execute
nearly any Tcl command, including core Tcl commands and any ns_*
commands. To see a sorted list of NaviServer Tcl commands, type:

[example_begin]
 lsort [lb]info commands ns*[rb]
[example_end]

[para]
Some useful NaviServer commands for nscp are:

[list_begin itemized]
[item] [cmd ns_shutdown] - Shuts down the server.
[item] [cmd "ns_info uptime"] - Displays how long the server has been running.
[item] [cmd "ns_info threads"] - Lists the current number of running threads.
[item] [cmd exit] - Exits the control port session.
[list_end]
