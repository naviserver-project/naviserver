Reverse Proxy Module for NaviServer
===================================
Release 0.1
-----------

    neumann@wu-wien.ac.at

This is a NaviServer module that implements a reverse proxy for
NaviServer based on the ns_connchan command. The modules provides
NaviServer filter procs, which can be registered for all or selected
urls via wildcards, that will redirect the incoming requests to some
backend service.

When the filter procs are registed as "postauth" filters, it is
possible to use NaviServer (or e.g. OpenACS) as authenticating reverse
proxy server. It is possible to specify for every registered filter a
validation callback (to validate access of the service) and a
exception callback (e.g. for returning tailored error pages).

Both the incoming and upstream connections might be based on http or
https. The implementation works as well with WebSockets (including
secure WebSockets).

The module requires at least NaviServer 4.99.14. The implementation is
based on nsf, which is available from e.g.  http://next-scripting.org/

Configuration:
--------------

In order to configure the reverse proxy, add the following lines to the
config file of NaviServer to make the ::revproxy::* functions available:

    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/modules"
       ns_param revproxy tcl

During startup of the server register the ::revproxy::upstream
function for some URLs, like in the following example, where GET and
POST requests  with /shiny/ are tunneled to some back end service
(here via https to my.backend.com).

    ns_register_filter postauth GET  /shiny/* ::revproxy::upstream -target https://my.backend.com/
    ns_register_filter postauth POST /shiny/* ::revproxy::upstream -target https://my.backend.com/

The registration might me happening in e.g. an OpenACS context in a
*-init.tcl file or in the config file of the server:

    ns_section "ns/server/${server}/module/revproxy"
       ns_param filters {
          ns_register_filter postauth GET  /shiny/* ::revproxy::upstream -target https://my.backend.com/
          ns_register_filter postauth POST /shiny/* ::revproxy::upstream -target https://my.backend.com/
       }
