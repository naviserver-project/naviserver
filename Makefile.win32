# nmake command to exec for each module:

# Note our use below of nmake's macro string substition feature:
#   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bsd42ets%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
#
# Our use of $(build_targets) below expands into a separate target for
# each module, which is especially convenient when we only want to
# build one or two of them at a time (e.g., for debugging).  But nmake
# does not have anything like Gnu make's explicit ".PHONY" syntax, so
# we must make sure that each target name is NOT a valid file or
# directory.  Thus our use of _, I, or C prefixes with each module
# name.
#
# Independently of this makefile, to clean a single module you can
# simply cd into its subdirectory in the DOS/command shell and run
# "nmake clean".  That works fine.  Or using this makefile, you can
# run the single "clean" target to clean them all, or one or more
# individual clean targets like "Cnsthread Cnsd".

# For the core Naviserver modules, we use the same module/Makefile for
# both make and nmake.  Unfortunately, it looks like that won't work
# for add-on modules.  Their makefiles have more diversity, and even
# if they are did NOT, there are still other stumbling blocks.  E.g.:
#
# Microsoft nmake supports an undocumented "include" command, but it
# apparently ONLY allows hard-coded paths, it does NOT allow using
# variables!  The documented "!include" command, on the other hand,
# uses variables in the way you'd expect.
#
# So for add-on modules, we will instead use separate
# module/Makefile.win32 files.
