[description]

[cmd ns_proxy] provides a simple, robust proxy mechanism to evaluate
Tcl scripts in a separate, pipe-connected process. This approach
can be useful both to isolate potentially thread-unsafe code outside
the address space of a multithreaded process such as NaviServer or
to enable separation and timeout of potentially misbehaving, long
running scripts.

[para]
The command is provided by the [emph nsproxy] dynamic library which
can be loaded into an interpreter via the Tcl [emph load] command,
for example:

[example_begin]
load [file /usr/local/lib/libnsproxy.so]
[cmd ns_proxy] ...
[example_end]

[para]
It is also possible to load the library into all interpreters of
an NaviServer virtual server by specifying an [emph nsproxy.so] entry
in the server's module config entry, for example:

[example_begin]
[cmd ns_section] "ns/server/server1/modules"
[cmd ns_param] nsproxy  nsproxy.so
[example_end]

[para]
When loaded, the library adds the single [cmd ns_proxy] command with
takes multiple options as described below. Proxies (i.e. slave
processes) are normally created on demand when requested and connected
to the parent process via pipes used to send scripts and receive response.
Proxies remain active until the parent process exits, effectively closing
all pipes to the slave processes, or when their idle timer expires, depending
on the setup of the [arg pool] (see [cmd "ns_proxy configure"]).

[para]
Proxies are obtained from their corresponding [arg pool] by means of the
[cmd "ns_proxy get"] command. Only the thread that obtained the proxy can use
it to communicate with the slave process. In order to allow other threads to
use the same proxy, the thread must return (via the [cmd "ns_proxy put"] or
[cmd "ns_proxy cleanup"] commands) the proxy back to it's/theirs correspondig
pool/s. One thread can obtain one or a bunch of proxies from a pool in one step.
It cannot, however, repeatedly obtain proxy by proxy in a loop, as this may
lead to difficult-to-trace deadlock situation (see [cmd "ns_proxy get"] command).


[section COMMANDS]

[list_begin definitions]


[call [cmd "ns_proxy pools"]]

Returns a list of all currently defined proxy pools.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy handles"]]

Returns list of all proxies allocated for the current interpreter.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy cleanup"]]

Releases any handles from any pools currently owned by a thread.

[para]
This command is intended to be used as part of a garbage collection
step.Calling this command within NaviServer is not necessary as the
module registers a trace to release all handles via the
[cmd "ns_ictl trace deallocate"] facility when interpreters are deallocated
after some transaction, for example, at the end of a connection.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy active"] [arg pool] [opt [arg handle]]]

Returns a list of currently evaluating scripts in proxies for
the given [arg pool].

[para]
The output is one or more lists, depending on the optional
[opt handle] argument. If the optional argument is
given, only the status of the proxy for the given handle is
returned and the result is a one-element list. Otherwise, stati of
all active proxies for the given [arg pool] are returned and the
result is a list of two or more elements.

[para]
Each element itself is a list which includes several keys: [emph handle],
[emph slave], [emph start], [emph script] and their associated values.
This format is suitable for filling in an Tcl array with the
[cmd "array set"] Tcl command.
The [emph handle] key contains the handle of the proxy.
The [emph slave] key contains the process-id of the slave process.
The [emph start] key contains the timestamp with the absolute time
when this proxy has been activated. The timestamp is in format that
[cmd ns_time] command understands.

[para]
The [emph script] contains the script passed to the proxy for execution.
It is also possible to view the currently evaluating scripts with the
Unix [emph ps] command as the proxy slave process re-writes it's command
argument space with the request script before evaluation and clears it
after sending the result.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy free"] [arg pool]]

Returns a list of all free proxies for the given [arg pool]. Free
proxies are those which are left in the pool queue waiting to
be used by the [cmd "ns_proxy get"] command. Some proxies may have
an active slave process attached, some not. If a slave process is
not attached to the free proxy, a new one will be created as soon
as the proxy is requested by some thread.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy clear"] [arg pool] [opt [arg handle]]]

Stop all slave processes attached to free proxies for the given [arg pool].
If the optional [arg handle] is given, it stops the process only for
that handle.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy stop"] [arg pool] [opt [arg handle]]]

Stop all slave processes attached to running proxies for the given [arg pool].
If the optional [arg handle] is given, it stops the process only for
that handle.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy configure"] [arg pool] [opt {-key val -key val...}]]

Configures options for the [arg pool]. The [arg pool] is created with
default options if it does not already exist. Default options for the
[arg pool] are taken from the NaviServer configuration file under the
section "ns/server/$servername/module/nsproxy". In case
the library is loaded in plain Tcl shell, default configuration options
are fixed and cannot be changed w/o recompiling the code.
Configurable options include:


[list_begin options]

[opt_def -init [arg script]]
Specifies a script to evaluate when proxies are started.  This can
be used to load additional libraries and/or source script files.
The default is no script.

[opt_def -reinit [arg script]]
Specifies a script to evaluate after being allocated and before
being returned to the caller. This can be used to re-initalize
the slave state. The default is no script.

[opt_def -maxslaves [arg n]]
Sets the maximum number of proxy slave processes. Requests for
proxies beyond the maximum will result in requesting threads
waiting for existing proxies to be available instead of creating
new proxy processes. Setting this value to 0 disables the pool,
causing all subsequent allocation requests to fail immediately
(currently allocated proxies, if any, remain valid).

[opt_def -maxruns [arg n]]
Sets the maximum number of activation of the proxy slave process.
When the limit it reached, the slave process is automatically restarted.

[opt_def -exec [arg program]]
Specifies the filename of a slave proxy program.  This defaults to
[emph nsproxy] in the [emph bin] subdirectory of the NaviServer
runtime. It is possible to create a custom program and enter the
proxy event loop with the [emph Ns_ProxyMain] application startup
routine; see the source code for details.

[opt_def -gettimeout [arg ms]]
Specifies the maximum time to wait to allocate handles from the pool.
The default is 5000 milliseconds.

[opt_def -evaltimeout [arg ms]]
Specifies the maximum time to wait for a script to be evaluated in
a proxy. This parameter can be overridden on a per-call basis with
the optional [opt timeout] parameter to [cmd "ns_proxy eval"].
The default is 0 milliseconds i.e. infinite.

[opt_def -sendtimeout [arg ms]]
[opt_def -recvtimeout [arg ms]]
Specifies the maximium time to wait to send a script and receive a
result from a proxy.  The default is 1000 milliseconds which assumes
minimal delay sending and receiving reasonably sized scripts and 
results over the connecting pipe.

[opt_def -waittimeout [arg ms]]
Specifies the maximum time to wait for a proxy to exit. The wait
is performed in a dedicated reaper thread. The reaper will close
the connection pipe and wait the given timeout. If the timeout is
exceeded, the reaper will send a SIGTERM signal and finally a SIGKILL
signal to ensure the process eventually exits. The default is 100
milliseconds which should be ample time for a graceful exit unless
the process is hung executing a very long, misbehaving script,
resulting in a more disruptive SIGTERM or SIGKILL.

[opt_def -idletimeout [arg ms]]
Specifies the maximum time for an idle slave process to live.
Minimum value is 5000 milliseconds. After expiry of the idle
timeout, the reaper thread will close the connection pipe and
wait [option -waittimeout] milliseconds for the process to die.
If the timeout is exceeded, the reaper will send a SIGTERM
signal and finally a SIGKILL signal (waiting [option -waittimeout]
milliseconds in between) to ensure the process eventually exits.

[opt_def -env [arg setname]]
Initializes the slave's process environment with keys/values
passed in the named NaviServer set (see command [cmd ns_set]).

[para]
Slave processes whose handles are already attached to some Tcl
interps by the means of the [cmd "ns_proxy get"] command) are not
expired automatically. The idle timer starts to count at the moment
their handles are put back to the pool by the [cmd "ns_proxy put"]
or [cmd "ns_proxy cleanup"] command.

[list_end]



[call [cmd "ns_proxy get"] \
     [arg pool] \
     [opt [option "-handles [arg n]"]] \
     [opt [option "-timeout [arg ms]"]] ]

Returns one or more handles to proxies from the specified [arg pool].

[para]
The [arg pool] will be created with default options if it does not
already exist. The optional [option -handle] can be used to
specify the number of handles to allocate, the default being 1.

[para]
The optional [opt {-timeout ms}] arguments specifies the maximum
amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the handles to become
available before raising an error (see ERROR HANDLING below
for details on handling errors).

[para]
Requesting more than one handle in a single call (if more than one
handle is required) is necessary as it is an error to request
handles from a [arg pool] from which handles are already owned by
the thread. This restriction is implemented to avoid possible
deadlock conditions.

[para]
The handle returned by this command can be used as a scalar value for
other [cmd ns_proxy] commands, or it can be used as Tcl command itself
(see [cmd "ns_proxy eval"] for more information).

[para]
The proxy [arg pool] naming convention allows proxy slaves to be started
under different Unix UID/GID then the server itself. For that to work,
the server must be running under root user (UID = 0). The naming
convention is simple: pool_name:<optional_user_id>:<optional_group_id>.

[para]
For example, to start the proxy for the pool "mypool" with user UID
of 100 the pool name can be constructed as: "mypool:100". To start the
proxy with UID of 100 and group GID of 200: "mypool:100:200". Instead
of numeric values user/group names can also be used.

[para]
Beware: if the main server is not running under privileged root user,
the startup of the proxy under some alternative UID/GID may/will fail.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy ping"] [arg handle]]

This command sends a null request to the proxy specified by the
[arg handle] argument. The proxy will be verified alive and restarted
if necessary.  This command is not normally required as the
[cmd "ns_proxy eval"] command will also verify and restart proxies
as needed.



[call [cmd "ns_proxy send"] [arg handle] [arg script]]

Sends [arg script] to the proxy specified by [arg handle].
(see ERROR HANDLING below for details on handling errors).



[call [cmd "ns_proxy wait"] [arg handle] [opt [arg timeout]]]

Waits for results from the proxy specified by [arg handle].
The optional [arg timeout] argument specifies a maximum number of
milliseconds to wait for the command to complete before raising an
error (see ERROR HANDLING below for details on handling errors).



[call [cmd "ns_proxy recv"] [arg handle]]

Reads result from the script from the proxy specified by [arg handle]
(see ERROR HANDLING below for details on handling errors).



[call [cmd "ns_proxy eval"] [arg handle] [arg script] [opt [arg timeout]]]

Evalutes [arg script] in the proxy specified by [arg handle].
The optional [opt timeout] argument specifies a maximum number of
milliseconds to wait for the command to complete before raising an
error (see ERROR HANDLING below for details on handling errors).

[para]
Alternatively, the [arg handle] itself may be used as Tcl command like
in the example below:

[example_begin]
set handle [lb][cmd ns_proxy] get mypool[rb]
$handle "short_running_proc"
$handle "long_running_proc" 20000
[example_end]



[call [cmd "ns_proxy put"] [arg handle]]

This command can be used to release a single proxy specified by the
[arg handle] argument. All handles owned by a thread to the
cooresponding pool must be returned before any handles can be
allocated again. Within the server, a call to this routine is
recommended for clarity but not strictly necessary. NaviServer installs
a trace to release all handles at the end of every connection during 
interpreter deallocation.

[list_end]



[section "ERROR HANDLING"]

Errors generated by a script evaluated in a proxy interpreter are
completely returned to the calling interpreter, including mapping
the [emph errorInfo] and [emph errorCode] global variables from the
proxy to the parent and raising a Tcl exception. This enables proxy
code to look very similar to that which may use the Tcl [cmd eval]
command.

[para]
Errors raised by a failure to communicate with the proxy process
due to a timeout or unexpected process exit are also communicated
back to the parent interpreter as Tcl exceptions.  To distinguish
between these cases, communication related errors set the
[emph errorCode] global variable with the first element
[emph NSPROXY].  The second element is one of the following:


[list_begin definitions]

[def EDeadlock]
The interpreter attempted to allocate handles from a pool from which
it already owns one or more handles.

[def EExec]
The slave program specified by the [arg {-exec program}] option could
not be started.

[def EImport]
The response from the proxy was invalid.

[def ERecv]
There was an error receiving the result from the slave process.

[def ESend]
There was an error sending the script to the slave process.

[def EGetTimeout]
Timeout while waiting to get a proxy handle from the pool.

[def EEvalTimeout]
Timeout while waiting for the response from the proxy process after
sending the command for evaluation.

[def ERange]
Requested too many proxy handles from the pool

[def EIdle]
Proxy is currently in the idle state.

[def EInit]
Evaluation of the init script failed.

[def EDead]
Proxy handle is currently not connected to any process.

[def EBusy]
Proxy handle is currently busy with the evaluation.

[list_end]



[section EXAMPLES]

[para]
The following demonstrates sending a script to a remote proxy:

[example_begin]
set handle [lb][cmd ns_proxy] get myproxy[rb]
[cmd ns_proxy] eval $handle {info patchlevel}
[cmd ns_proxy] release $handle
[example_end]

Alternatively, instead of using the scalar handle you can use
the handle directly as an Tcl command:

[example_begin]
set handle [lb][cmd ns_proxy] get myproxy[rb]
$handle {info patchlevel}
rename $handle ""
[example_end]


The following demonstrates using multiple proxies:

[example_begin]
[cmd ns_proxy] config myproxy -maxslaves 10
set handles [lb][cmd ns_proxy] get myproxy -handle 10[rb]
foreach h $handles {
    $h {puts "alive: [lb]pid[rb]"}
}
[cmd ns_proxy] cleanup
[example_end]
