[section {What is CGI and How Does it Work?}]


[para]


CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a standard way of running programs
from a Web server. Often, CGI programs are used to generate pages
dynamically or to perform some other action when someone fills out an
HTML form and clicks the submit button. NaviServer provides full
support for CGI v1.1.


[para]


Basically, CGI works like this:


[para]


A reader sends a URL that causes the NaviServer to use CGI to run a
program. The NaviServer passes input from the reader to the program
and output from the program back to the reader. CGI acts as a
"gateway" between the NaviServer and the program you write.


[para]


The program run by CGI can be any type of executable file on the
server platform. For example, you can use C, C++, Perl, Unix shell
scripts, Fortran, or any other compiled or interpreted language. You
can also use Tcl scripts with CGI, though the NaviServer API will not
be available to them.


[para]


With NaviServer, you have the option of using the embedded Tcl and C
interfaces instead of CGI. Typically, the Tcl and C interfaces provide
better performance than CGI. (See the NaviServer Tcl Developer's Guide
for information on the Tcl interface and the NaviServer C Developer's
Guide for information on the C interface.)


[para]


You may want to use CGI for existing, shareware, or freeware programs
that use the standard CGI input, output, and environment variables.
Since CGI is a standard interface used by many Web servers, there are
lots of example programs and function libraries available on the World
Wide Web and by ftp. This chapter describes the interface and points
you to locations where you can download examples.


[para]


For example, suppose you have a form that lets people comment on your
Web pages. You want the comments emailed to you and you want to
automatically generate a page and send it back to your reader.


[list_begin enum]


[enum] The reader fills out your form and clicks the "Submit" button.
     The FORM tag in your page might look like this:


[example_begin]


<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="/cgi-bin/myprog">


[example_end]



[para]


The METHOD controls how the information typed into the form is
passed to your program. It can be "GET" or "POST". The ACTION
determines which program should be run.


[para]


Other ways for a reader to run a program are by providing a direct
link to the program without allowing the reader to supply any
variables through a form, or by using the ISINDEX tag.

[enum] When NaviServer gets a request for a URL that maps to a CGI
     directory or a CGI file extension (as defined in the configuration
     file), it starts a separate process and runs the
     program within that process. The NaviServer also sets up a number of
     environment variable within that process. These environment variables
     include some standard CGI variables, and optionally
     any variables you define in the configuration file for this type of
     program.

[enum] The program runs. The program can be any type of
     executable program. For example, you can use C, C++, Perl, Unix shell
     scripts, or Fortran.


[para]


     In this example, the program takes the comments from the form as
     input and sends them to you as email. If
     the form method is "GET", it gets the input from an
     environment variable. If the form method is "POST", it
     gets the input from standard input. It also assembles a
     HTML page and sends it to standard output.

[enum] Any information the program passes to standard output is
     automatically sent to the NaviServer when the program finishes running.

[enum] The server adds any header information needed to identify the
     output and sends it back to the reader's browser, which displays the
     output.


[list_end]


[section {Configuring CGI with NaviServer}]


[para]


You can control the behavior of NaviServer's CGI interface by setting
parameters in a configuration file. For example, you can control which
files and directories are treated as CGI programs, you can determine
how to run various types of programs, and you can set a group of
environment variables for each type of program you use.


[para]


Note that if you're defining multiple servers, you will need to
configure the CGI interface for each server.

[para]

To enable and configure CGI:

[list_begin enum]
[enum]
Edit your NaviServer configuration file, usually named nsd.tcl.

[enum]
Choose the server for which you want to enable CGI (such as for
example the server named [const Server1]). Then add the CGI
module to that server such it will be loaded at start time.
For example:

[example_begin]

   ns_section "ns/server/Server1/modules"
      ns_param nscgi nscgi.so

[example_end]


[enum]Add a section for the server with the suffix
    [const "module/nscgi"] to configure the modules
    with certain parameters. One has to define typically the
    mappings via the parameter [const Map] to
    indicate, what HTTP-method with which path
    should be directed to a corresponding CGI program. Typically,
    the mapping will point to a directory on the machine in which the
    CGI scripts are located.

    [para]
    The value specified via the parameter [const map] is of the form
    [para]
      [arg method] [arg pattern] [arg ?path?]

    [para]
    where [arg method] refers to the HTTP request method (i.e., HEAD,
        GET, POST, etc.), [arg pattern] refers to either a relative
	URL or a glob pattern to match on the HTTP request.  This is how nscgi
        determines whether a request is a CGI request.
        [arg path] is optional and indicates either
        the directory where the CGI executables can be found, or the
        executable that should be used to fulfill the CGI request.
	[para] If
	[arg path] is not specified, then the URL must refer a file
        which is the CGI executable.  If [arg path] is specified and is a
        directory, then the filename portion of the URL must refer to a
        CGI executable in that directory.  Otherwise, [arg path] must
	refer to a CGI executable which will handle all requests for this
	[arg pattern].
	
    For example:

[example_begin]
   ns_section "ns/server/Server1/module/nscgi"
      ns_param Map  "GET /cgi /usr/local/cgi"
      ns_param Map  "POST /*.cgi"
[example_end]


[enum]
If you want to call a CGI program (script) which requires an interpreter (e.g.,
    Perl or bash), you will need to define the CGI interpreters via
    the module parameter [const Interps].

    [list_begin itemized]

    [item] Add a definition for the [const Interps] parameter to your CGI
        configuration section using e.g. the name [const cgi]. 

[example_begin]
   ns_section "ns/server/Server1/module/nscgi"
      ns_param Map    "GET /cgi /usr/local/cgi"
      ns_param Map    "POST /*.cgi"
      ns_param Interps cgi
[example_end]


    [item] Then add a section under [const ns/interps] for the chosen
        name (here [const cgi]) and add there the mappings
	from file extensions to the
	script interpreters. When a CGI script with a specified extension
	is to be executed, NaviServer will call it via the named executables.

[example_begin]
   ns_section "ns/interps/cgi"
      ns_param .pl  "c:\perl\bin\perl.exe"
      ns_param .sh  "c:\mks\mksnt\sh.exe(MKSenv)"
[example_end]



[list_end]

[enum]
In case the CGI script or the script interpreter requires additional
environment variables, one can define this via the module parameter
[const Environment] and a matching section for the detail definitions.

    [list_begin itemized]

    [item] Add a definition for the [const Environment] parameter to your CGI
        configuration section.


[example_begin]
   ns_section "ns/server/Server1/module/nscgi"
      ns_param Map         "GET /cgi /usr/local/cgi"
      ns_param Map         "POST /*.cgi"
      ns_param Interps     cgi
      ns_param Environment cgi
[example_end]

    [item] Then add a section under [const ns/environment] for the chosen
       name (here [const cgi])
       containing the required environment variable definitions.

[example_begin]
   ns_section "ns/environment/cgi"
      ns_param FOO BAR     ;# defines environment variable "FOO=BAR"
      ns_param TMP /tmp    ;# defines environment variable "TMP=/tmp"
[example_end]

[list_end]

[enum]
Further configuration parameter for [const module/nscgi] are:

[list_begin itemized]

[item] [const gethostbyaddr] is a boolean parameter to indicate
whether to resolve the peer IP address to its hostname when setting
the REMOTE_HOST environment variable.  If [const false], the peer IP address
will be used instead.  Caution: turning this option on can negatively
impact performance due to the overhead of having to perform a DNS
look-up on every CGI request. Default: [const off]

[item] [const limit] is an integer parameter to indicate the maximum
number of concurrent CGI requests to execute. [const 0] means
unlimited. Default: [const 0]

[item] [const maxinput] is an integer parameter to indicate the
maximum in bytes to accept in the HTTP request. [const 0] means unlimited.
Mostly useful to limit the size of POST'ed data. Default: [const 1024000]
      
[item] [const maxwait] is an integer parameter to indicate the amount
      of time to wait in seconds in the queue when the concurrency
      limit has been reached.  Server will respond with a "503 Service
      Unavailable" error on timeout.  If [const limit] is set to [const 0],
      this setting will have no effect. Default: [const 30]

[item] [const systemenvironment] is a boolean parameter to controls
      whether the CGI will inherit the server process's environment
      variables or not.  Enabling this could potentially leak
      sensitive information from the parent's environment if the CGI
      displays its environment variables which is the behavior of some
      common error-handling code. Default: [const false]

[list_end]
[list_end]


[section {How Web Pages Run CGI Programs}]

There are several ways a Web page can run a CGI program:

[list_begin itemized]
[item]
    [emph {Direct Link:}] A link in your page can reference a CGI program
    directly. Normally, such links are used when you do not need to
    send any variables to the program.

[item]
   [emph "[const ISINDEX] Tag:"] This tag can be included in the [const <HEAD>] section of
    the page. For example, you could add this tag:

[example_begin]
   <ISINDEX HREF="/cgi-bin/search.pl" PROMPT="Search for:">
[example_end]

    Normally, the [const ISINDEX] tag is used to run search programs, but
    this is not a requirement. You can use this tag to run CGI programs
    if you don't care where the field is located in your page and your
    program accepts a single variable.

[para]

   When you use this tag, the browser adds a field to the Web page.
   Readers can type a string in this field. The server
   decodes the text the reader typed and sends it to your
   CGI program as separate command-line arguments. The
   advantage is you don't need to decode the input.

[item] [emph {Form:}] You can create a form with multiple fields. Use forms to run
    CGI programs when your readers can choose or type values for one
    or more variables.The [const METHOD] attribute of the HTML
    form an be either [const GET] or [const POST].

    [list_begin itemized]

    [item] The [const GET] method causes the field names and values to be
        passed to the program in the [const QUERY_STRING] environment
        variable.

    [item] The [const POST] method causes the field names and values to be
        passed to the program through standard input. If the input
        from your form may be long, it is best to use the POST method
        because long strings can be truncated when they are assigned
        to an environment variable.

[list_end]



[list_end]


[subsection {URLs that Run CGI Programs}]

For each method of running a CGI program described in the previous
section, the browser software sends a URL to the server. (In addition,
the HTTP header sent with the URL includes some environment
variables).

[para]

Generally the URL to run a CGI program can have these parts:

[para]

[emph "CGI path[lb]/extra path information [rb][lb]?query string[rb]"]

[list_begin itemized]

[item] The [emph "CGI path"] is the location of the CGI program to run. The path
    can be a relative or absolute reference to the program file.

[item] The optional [emph "extra path"] information can be included in the URL to
    provide either a directory location the CGI program should use or
    some extra information for the CGI program. The path is relative
    to the root directory for Web pages. The extra path information is
    available to the CGI program in the PATH_INFO environment
    variable.

[item] The optional [emph "query string"] is preceded by a question mark (?) and
    contains either a single variable or a set of field names and
    variables for the CGI program to use. The query string is
    available to the CGI program in either the [const QUERY_STRING]
    environment variable or the standard input location (if the form
    method is [const POST]).
[list_end]


[para]

For example, the query string from a form with 3 fields could be:


[para]

[const Field1=Value1&Field2=Value2&Field3=Value3]

[para]

Spaces in the query string are replaced with plus signs (+). Any
special characters (such as ?, =, &, +) are replaced with %xx, where
xx is the hexadecimal value for that character.

[para]

Here are some examples of URLs that could run a CGI program:

[list_begin itemized]

[item] [const http://www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/gettime]


[para]


   This URL runs the gettime program, which could return a page with
   the current time. There are no variables, so you might
   use this as a direct link.

[item] [const http://www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/listdir/misc/mydir]

[para]

   This URL runs the listdir program and passes it /misc/mydir as
   extra path information. This might be a direct link in a page.

[item] [const http://www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/search?navigate]


[para]

   This URL runs the search program and passes it the word
   "navigate" as input. This URL doesn't include any field
   names, so it might be passed by pages with an ISINDEX tag.

[item] [const http://www.webcrawler.com/cgi-bin/WebQuery?searchText=word]


[para]


   This is a real URL that runs the WebCrawler search program and
   passes a value for the searchText field of "word".
   Normally, CGI programs that accept field values like
   these are run from a form.


[list_end]



[para]


If your programs are not executed, make sure the program file allows
 read and execute access.



[section {Input to CGI Programs}]


[para]


CGI programs can get input from these sources:

[list_begin itemized]

[item] Command line: The only type of input that go to the command line
    of a CGI program are values typed into an ISINDEX field and
    query strings that do not contain an "=" sign (from a direct
    link). Forms cannot send variables to the command line.

[item] Environment variables: A number of standard environment variables
    are always available to the CGI program. You can
    specify additional environment variables in the NaviServer
    configuration file. And, if the METHOD for a form
    is GET, the field names and values are stored in the QUERY_STRING
    environment variable.

[item] Standard input: If the METHOD for a form is POST, the field names
    and values are sent to standard input.
[list_end]


[subsection {Accessing Environment Variables}]

Different languages allow you to access environment variables in
different ways. Here are some examples:

[para]
[emph  {C or C++}]

[example_begin]
  #include <stdlib.h>;
  
  char *browser = getenv("HTTP_USER_AGENT");
[example_end]

[emph {Perl}]

[example_begin]
  $browser = $ENV{'HTTP_USER_AGENT'};
[example_end]


[emph {Bourne shell}]


[example_begin]
  BROWSER=$HTTP_USER_AGENT
[example_end]


[emph {C shell}]

[example_begin]
  set BROWSER = $HTTP_USER_AGENT
[example_end]


[subsection {Standard Environment Variables}]

These standard environment variables are defined for all CGI programs
by the NaviServer:

[para]

[emph AUTH_TYPE:]

[para]

If the server supports user authentication, and the script is
protected, this is the protocol-specific authentication method used to
validate the user. For CGI programs run by NaviServer, this is always
"Basic".

[para]

Example: Basic

[para]

[emph CONTENT_LENGTH:]

[para]


If the CGI program is run by a form with the POST method, this
variable contains the length of the contents of standard input in
bytes. There is no null or EOF character at the end of standard input,
so in some languages (such as C and Perl) you should check this
variable to find out how many bytes to read from standard input.


[para]


Example: 442


[para]


[emph  CONTENT_TYPE:]


[para]


If the CGI program is run by a form with the POST method, this
variable contains the MIME type of the information sent by the
browser. Currently, all browsers should send the information as
[const application/x-www-form-urlencoded].
Other types may be added in the future.


[para]


[emph  GATEWAY_INTERFACE:]


[para]


The version number of the CGI specification this server supports.


[para]


Example: CGI/1.1


[para]


[emph  HTTP_ACCEPT:]


[para]


A comma-separated list of the MIME types the browser will accept, as
specified in the HTTP header the browser sends. Many browsers do not
send complete lists, and the list does not include external viewers
the user has installed. If you want to send browser-specific output,
you may also want to check the browser name, which is specified by the
HTTP_USER_AGENT variable.

[para]

Examples:

[example_begin]
 */*, application/x-navidoc
 */*, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg
[example_end]

[para]


[emph  HTTP_FROM:]

[para]

This variable may contain the email address of the reader who caused
the CGI program to run. However, some browsers do not send the email
address for privacy reasons. And, users may enter false email
addresses in their preferences settings.

[para]

Example: [const itsme@mydomain.com]

[para]

[emph  HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE:]

[para]


This variable contains a date and time if the browser wants a response
only if the data has been modified since the specified date and time.
The date is in GMT standard time. Many browsers do not send this
information.


[para]


Example: [const "Thursday, 23-Nov-95 17:00:00 GMT"]


[para]


[emph  HTTP_REFERER:]


[para]


This variable contains the URL of the page or other location from
which the reader sent the request to run the CGI program. For example,
if the reader runs the program from a form, this variable contains the
URL of that form.


[para]


Example: [const http://www.mydomain.com/mydir/feedback.htm]


[para]


[emph  HTTP_USER_AGENT:]


[para]

This variable tells which browser the reader is using to send the
request. Normally, the format is "browser name/version".

[para]

Example: [const "Mozilla/1.2N (Windows; I; 16bit)"]

[para]

[emph  PATH_INFO:]

[para]

This variable contains any extra path information included in the URL
sent by the browser. Commonly, this type of URL is used to pass a
relative directory location to your program. For example, the
following URL runs the listdir program and passes it /misc/mydir as
extra path information:


[para]

[const http://www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/listdir/misc/mydir]

[para]

Another use for this type of URL is to pass information to the program
without using a form or to pass form-specific variables in addition to
the user-specified variables. For example:

[para]

[const http://www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/search/keyword=navigate]

[para]

Examples: [const /misc/mydir/keyword=navigate]


[para]


[emph  PATH_TRANSLATED:]


[para]


This variable translates the relative path from PATH_INFO into the
absolute path by prepending the server's root directory for Web
documents. This is useful because PATH_INFO, which the reader can
view, need not reveal the physical location of your files on the
server.


[para]


Example: [const /NaviServer/pages/misc/mydir]


[para]


[emph  QUERY_STRING:]


[para]


This variable contains information passed by a form or link to the
program. The QUERY_STRING contains information in the following
situations:

[list_begin itemized]

[item]  The reader submitted a form that uses the GET method.

[item]  The reader submitted a query in a page with the ISINDEX tag.
     (The text the user types is also decoded and sent to the program's
     command line in this situation. The QUERY_STRING provides the
     non-decoded information.)

[item]  A direct link included information after a "?" in the URL.


[list_end]



[para]


The QUERY_STRING is encoded in a format like this:


[para]


[const Field1=Value1&Field2=Value2&Field3=Value3]


[para]


Your CGI program should decode the QUERY_STRING. Functions that decode
this string are publicly available functions for most languages. The
string encoding follows these rules:

[list_begin itemized]

[item] Field name/value pairs are separated by an "&" sign.

[item] A field's name and its value are separated by an "=" sign. Field
    names are specified by the NAME attribute. Field values depend on
    the type of field:

[list_end]



[para]


  Text field and text area: The value is the text typed into the
 field. Multiline text is sent as one line with the return
 character encoded as described below.


[para]


  Radio Buttons: The value is the value of the button that is
 selected.


[para]

  Checkbox: The name and value usually appear in the list only if
 the box is checked. Some browsers may send the name of
 the checkbox only.

[para]

  Selection List: The value of a selection list is the text of the
 item that is selected. If multiple items can be selected,
 there is a name/value pair with the same name for each
 item that is selected.

[para]

  Image Field: Two name value pairs are sent. ".x" and ".y" are
 added to the field name and the values are the x and y
 coordinates (measured in pixels from an origin at the
 upper-left corner of the image). For example:

[para]


[const Figfield.x=185&Figfield.y=37]


[para]


Hidden Fields: You can use hidden fields with fixed values (or values
 set when a CGI program generated the page). The value is set
 with the VALUE attribute. Some older browsers make hidden
 fields visible.


[para]


Range Fields: The value is the numeric value of the field (sent as a
 string). Some browsers do not support range fields.


[para]


Named Submit Buttons: You can place multiple Submit buttons in a form.
 If you add a NAME attribute to the Submit button, that name
 will be sent, along with the label of the button as the value.
 All the Submit buttons in a form run the same CGI program, but
 the CGI program can perform different actions based on which
 button was clicked. Some browsers do not support named submit
 buttons.


[para]


[list_begin itemized]

[item]  Spaces are replaced by "+" signs.

[item]  Special characters are replaced by a "%" sign followed by the
 hexadecimal value of the character. Here are some common
 characters and their hex values:

[list_end]

[para]

[example_begin]
 # -- %23
 = -- %3D
 / -- %2F
 % -- %25
 : -- %3A
 \ -- %5C
 & -- %26
 ; -- %3B
 tab -- %0A
 + -- %2B
 ? -- %3F
 return -- %09
[example_end]


[emph  REMOTE_ADDR:]


[para]


The IP address of the machine from which or through which the browser
is making the request. This information is always available.


[para]


Example: [const 199.221.53.76]


[para]


[emph  REMOTE_HOST:]


[para]


The full domain name of the machine from which or through which the
browser is making the request. If this variable is blank because the
browser did not send the information, use the REMOTE_ADDR variable
instead.


[para]


Example: [const mybox.company.com]


[para]


[emph  REMOTE_USER:]


[para]


If the server prompted the reader for a username and password because
the script is protected by the NaviServer's access control, this
variable contains the username the reader provided.


[para]


Example: [const nsadmin]


[para]


[emph  REQUEST_METHOD:]


[para]


The method used to send the request to the server. For direct links,
the method is "GET". For requests from forms, the method may be "GET"
or "POST". Another method is "HEAD", which CGI programs can treat like
"GET" or can provide header information without page contents.


[para]


[emph  SCRIPT_NAME:]


[para]


The virtual path to the CGI script or program being executed from the
URL used to execute the script. You may want to use this variable if
the program generates a page that contains a form that can be used to
run the program again -- for example, to search for another string.


[para]


Example: [const /cgi-bin/search]


[para]


[emph  SERVER_NAME:]


[para]

The full hostname, domain name alias, or IP address of the server that
ran the CGI program.

[para]

Example: [const www.mysite.com]

[para]

[emph  SERVER_PORT:]


[para]


The server port number to which the request was sent. This may be any
number between 1 and 65,535 (that is not already a well-known port).
The default is 80.


[para]


Example: [const 80]


[para]


[emph  SERVER_PROTOCOL:]


[para]


The name and version number of the information protocol used to pass
this request from the client to the server.


[para]


Example: [const HTTP/1.0]


[para]


[emph  SERVER_SOFTWARE:]


[para]


The name and version number of the server software running the CGI
program.


[para]


Example: [const NaviServer/4.99.6]


[para]


 Other Environment Variables:


[para]


In addition to the preceding environment variables, the HTTP header
lines received from the client, if any, are placed into the
environment with the prefix HTTP_ followed by the header name. Any
spaces in the header name are changed to underscores (_). The server
may exclude any headers it has already processed, such as
Content-type, and Content-length.


[para]


Also, you can specify environment variables to be passed to a CGI
program in the NaviServer configuration file.


[para]


 Accessing Standard Input


[para]


If a form uses the POST method to send a request, the field names and
values are sent to standard input and the length of this string is
provided in the CONTENT_LENGTH environment variable. The format of the
standard input string is the same as the format of the QUERY_STRING
environment variable when the GET method is used.


[para]


Different languages allow you to access the standard input in
different ways. Here are some simplified examples. Your programs
should also do some error checking.


[para]

[emph {C or C++}]

[example_begin]
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <stdlib.h>
 #define MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH 10000
 
 char *inputlenstr;
 int inputlen;
 int status;
 char inputtext[lb]MAX_INPUT_LENGTH+1[rb];

[section {Output from CGI Programs}]


[para]


To send output from a CGI program to the reader's browser, you send
the output to the standard output location. Different languages allow
you to send text to standard output in different ways. Here are some
examples:


[para]


[emph {C or C++}]

[example_begin]
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>

  printf("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n");
  printf("<HEAD><TITLE>Hello</TITLE></HEAD>");
  printf("<BODY>You are using %s.</BODY>",
  getenv("HTTP_USER_AGENT") );
[example_end]

[emph Perl]

[example_begin]

  #!/opt/local/bin/perl
  print "Content-type: text/plain\r\n\r\n";
  for my $var ( sort keys %ENV ) {
    printf "%s = \"%s\"\r\n", $var, $ENV{$var};
  }
  
[example_end]


[emph {Bourne shell}]

[example_begin]

  echo Content-type: text/html
  echo 
  echo \<HEAD\>\<TITLE\>Hello\</TITLE\>\</HEAD\>
  echo \<BODY\>
  echo You are using $HTTP_USER_AGENT.\</BODY\>

[example_end]

[para]


 HTTP Headers


[para]


Messages sent between a Web browser and a Web server contain header
information that the software uses to determine how to display or
interpret the information. The header information is not displayed by
the browser.


[para]


The NaviServer automatically generates some HTTP header information and
your program can add other information to the header.


[para]


 Header Information Generated by NaviServer

[para]

When your CGI program sends output to the standard output location,
the server automatically adds the following HTTP header information
before sending the output to the reader's browser:

[example_begin]
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
MIME-Version: 1.0
Server: NaviServer/3.0
Date: Monday, 06-Nov-95 17:50:15 GMT
Content-length: 20134
[example_end]

[para]

However, if the name of your CGI program begins with "nph-", the
NaviServer will not parse the output you send. Instead, the output is
sent directly to the client. In this case, you must include the
information above in your output. Generally, it is best to avoid using
this "non-parsed header" feature because any errors may be sent to
standard output and could make the header information incorrect. Also,
with non-parsed headers, the server does not interpret the output, so
the response code and content length are written out as 0 (zero) and 0
(zero) in the access log file.

[para]

 Header Information Generated by Your Program

[para]

You can specify header information at the beginning of the output you
send back to the client. After the header, add a blank line and then
start the output you want the reader to see. The blank line is
required. Your program should always send the Content-type header
(unless you are using the Location header). The other headers listed
below it are optional. For example,

[para]



[example_begin]
Content-type: text/html
 
<HTML>
<HEAD><TITLE>My title</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>text goes here...</BODY>
</HTML>
[example_end]


[const Content-type:]


[para]


You should always use this header to specify the MIME type of the
output you are sending (unless you are using the Location header). If
you are sending an HTML page as output, use a Content-type of
text/html. If you are sending untagged text, send a Content-type of
text/plain. If you send images, you might use a Content-type of
image/gif or image/jpeg. You can send any type of output from your CGI
program -- just be sure to specify the correct MIME type.


[para]

Example: [const "Content-type: text/html"]

[para]

[const  Content-encoding:]

[para]


Use this header if the output you are sending is compressed. The
Content-type should specify the type of the uncompressed file. For
example, use x-gzip for GNU zip compression and x-compress for
standard UNIX compression.


[para]

Example: [const "Content-encoding: x-compress"]


[para]


[const  Expires:]


[para]


Use this header to specify when the browser should consider the file
"out-of-date". Browsers can use this date to determine whether to load
the page from their local cache of pages or to reload the file from
the server.


[para]


Example: [const "Expires: Monday, 06-Nov-95 17:50:15 GMT"]


[para]

[const  Location:]


[para]


Use this header if you want to send an existing document as output.
The server automatically sends the document you specify to the
browser. You will probably want to specify a full URL for the
Location. If you specify a complete URL (such as,
http://www.mysite.com/out/response.htm), relative references in that
file will be resolved using the information in the URL you specify. If
you specify a relative URL (such as /out/response.htm), references in
that file will be resolved using the directory that contains the CGI
program.


[para]


If you send a Location header, you do not need to send a Content-type
header. However, you may want to send HTML-tagged text including a
link to the location for browsers that do not support this type of
redirection. You can specfy any type of URL as the output location.
For example, you can send an FTP, Gopher, or News URL.


[para]


Example: [const "Location: http://www.my.org/outbox/accepted.html"]


[para]


[const  Status:]


[para]


The NaviServer sends a status code to the browser in the first line of
every HTTP header. The default status code for success is "200 OK".
You can send other status codes by specifying the Status header.


[para]


Some browsers may not know how to handle all HTTP status codes, so
your program should also send HTML output after the header to describe
error situations that occur.


[para]


Example: [const "Status: 401 Unauthorized"]


[para]


 Sending HTML


[para]


To send a Web page to a reader's browser from a CGI program, first
output this line followed by a blank line:

[para]

[const "Content-type: text/html"]

[para]


Then, generate and output the HTML tags and content that make up the
page. You can send any HTML tags you would normally use when creating
pages.

[para]

If the file you want to send already exists, you can use the Location
header described in the previous section to send that file as output
from the CGI program.

[section {Advice for CGI Programming}]

[para]

[list_begin itemized]

[item]  Which language should I use? You can use any language you feel
 comfortable programming in. Of course, programs usually run faster
 in compiled language, so if your program is computationally
 intensive, you might want to use C or another compiled language.
 Most of the examples and shareware programs available on the Web
 are written in C or Perl.


[item]  How can I prevent CGI programs from causing security problems? A
 CGI program is basically a program that you let anyone else in the
 world run on your system. Someone with bad intentions could cause
 you some problems if you don't follow these rules:

 [list_begin itemized]

 [item]  Keep your CGI programs in a separate CGI directory or give
      them the file extension you specify in the configuration
      file. Don't give outsiders write access to these files and
      directories This should prevent casual users from reading,
      modifying, or adding CGI programs.

 [item]  Don't allow server-parsed HTML to run on your CGI directory
      or on files with extensions mapped as CGI programs.

 [item]  Don't trust the data the browser sends to your program. Parse
      the QUERY_STRING or standard input. If your program is a
      non-compiled script, characters with special meanings in that
      language can cause problems if the browser fails to encode
      them as hexadecimal values.

 [item]  Check for odd file names and directory paths in the input.
      For example, you should be careful about allow paths
      containing: ., ../, //, or the name of the directory that
      contains your CGI programs.

 [item]  Be careful with statements that construct and execute a
      command line or system call using input from the reader. For
      example, be careful using the eval statement in Perl and the
      Bourne shell. If the reader sends input that begins with a
      semicolon (;), they may be able to get your system to perform
      any command they like. Likewise, if you use calls to popen()
      and system(), make sure you put a backslash (\) before any
      characters with special meaning in the shell that will run.

[list_end]


[item]  How can I debug my CGI programs? Errors that go to the stderr
     location will be available in the NaviServer's server.log file.


[para]


  One simple way to debug CGI programs is to temporarily include
 print statements that send additional diagnostic
 information to the client or to a file. If your program
 is written in C and you have a debugging tool on your
 system, you can call sleep (or use a long loop) at the
 beginning of the program. Then, you can attach to the
 program with the debugger while the program is sleeping.


[para]


  If your programs are not executed, make sure the program file
 allows read and execute access.


[item]  How can I debug my nscgi configuration?
[para]
  For debugging the nsgci configuration, you one can turn on
  logging for the error.log via the command:

[example_begin]
    ns_logctl severity Debug(cgi) on
[example_end]
