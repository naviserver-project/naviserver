======================================
NaviServer 4.99.3, released XXXX-XX-XX
======================================

New Features:

    * New lazy Tcl interpreter initialization option. Saves memory and speeds
      initialization of interp on first use by defining procs on-demand.
      See: tcl/lazyloader parameter below.

    * New module nsproxy executes Tcl scripts via pool of external
      processes. Useful to keep buggy/non-thread-safe code isolated from
      main server process. See also: ns_job.

    * Log filter callbacks (Tcl and C) may be added to the error log stream
      to handle particular kinds of log messages by e.g. logging to a separate
      file.

    * Error logging may now be disabled/enabled at runtime with the
      ns_logctl command.

    * User-defined named log severities may be created using the ns_logctl
      command. These may be enabled/disabled individually, at runtime, unlike
      the old numeric user-levels.

    * New limits feature. Connection limits can be bundled together into a
      named set of limits and then applied to a subset of the URL
      hierarchy. The max number of connection threads running and waiting to
      run a URL, the max upload file size, and the max time a connection
      should wait to run are all configurable.
      See ns/limits parameters below.

    * ns_cache_create now takes a -maxentry switch limits the max size of an
      entry allowed into the cache to prevent wasteful cache flushes.

    * ns_cache_create now takes a -timeout switch which is the default timeout
      for one thread to wait for another to complete an ns_cache_eval command,
      if the -timeout switch is not given to the ns_cache_eval command itself.

    * Time values passed to commands such as the -timeout switch of
      ns_cache_eval now distinguish between an absolute time in the future and
      an offset from the current time. A heuristic is used: large values are
      absolute times in the future.

    * A new [ns_cache_eval -force ...] switch replaces any existing cached value
      whether it is up to date or not.

    * A new ns_cache_stats -contents switch dumps the expire and size of each
      entry in the cache cache. Useful when developing / testing to check
      utilisation.

    * The new [ns_conn keepalive ?bool?] sub-command disables or requests
      keepalive behavior for the current connection.

    * ns_getcsv now takes a -delimiter switch.

    * ns_parseargs: default values can now be specified with a leading '='
      which signifies the value should be eval'ed to generate the default.

    * Commands which timeout now set a NS_TIMEOUT Tcl error code, which if not
      caught is reported as an HTTP 503 Unavailable response.

    * Handle png images, as well as existing gif and jpg with new ns_img*
      commands.

    * New [ns_mutex eval script] to safely handle unlocking on error.

    * Thread commands now takes names as well as thread-object references.

    * New options jobsperthread and jobtimeout for ns_job command to perform
      automatic job threads exit in case of idle or max number of jobs reached

    * Updated ns_perm module to support missing checkpass and sepass commands

    * ns_http was ported from Aolserver 4.5 and uses new task API

    * ADP parser was ported from AS 4.5 and also used for processing .tcl files

    * New option acceptsize for driver to tell how many connection can be accepted at once,
      this improves performance significantly in case of large number of incoming connections

    * New Ns_Sls* and ns_sls commands supporting socket-local-storage (data which persists for 
      the lifetime of an open TCP connection)

    * ns_httpget now supports chunked encoding in results

    * ns_return etc. will now gzip the body content, if that option is enabled.

    * Static files can now be sent using the OS native sendfile() on
      supported platforms (currently Linux).

    * ns_unregister_op is now the correct way to unregister procs, adp, and tcl
      pages. (The older names are kept around for backwards compat.)

    * NaviServer now builds on Win32 using the standard configure scripts and
      the MingWin32 compiler.

    * New command ns_mutex trylock which works similar to the same C API function

    * New command ns_filestat which is similar to file stat but uses direct system 
      call instead of Tcl VFS

    * New command ns_db rowcount, which return the number of affected rows after a
      DML operation.

    * Support for If-Range: header in conditional range requests, this makes the server
      more RFC compliant and allows file retrievals, re-gets and file mirroring without 
      additional coding, it is all done by the server and HTTP

Bug Fixes:

    * Various 64bit fixes.
    * Fix path attribute of HTP Cookie string.
    * Make sure upload stats lock is unlocked after use.
    * Fix crash in writer thread logging already freed data.
    * Fix crashes in cache code due to incorrect expired entry flushing fixed.
    * Only add cache commands to virtual server interps.
    * Don't inflate flush-stats on cache eval error.
    * Custom error documents (return redirects) now send back the correct HTTP
    * response code. Used to always report 200, success.
    * Make unsetting an environment variable work cross platform.
    * Fix bug where executable name was freed before use.
    * Don't delete bound Unix domain sockets.
    * Fix typo in ns_setexpires command.
    * Windows: block SIGPIPE.
    * Windows: fix stdin, stdout, stderr channel initialization.
    * Fix infinite loop in spooler thread code.
    * Message line-breaking of email bodies sent with ns_sendmail now works
      correctly for non ASCII data.
    * Files over 2 Gb are supported for logging, serving, uploads, etc.
    * Fixed ns_sendmail for cases when message body is large and it fails to
      send all body because of nonblocking socket mode
    * Fix a race condition in the fastpath code which could allow random files
      anywhere on the same filesystem to be served by the server.


Incompatible API Changes:

    * ns_setcookie -maxage renamed -expires to match common usage throughout
      code.

    * All cookies are now set HttpOnly by default. The -scriptable option must
      be true for the client javascript engine to have access to the cookies.

    * The 'secure' flag of Ns_ConnSetCookieEx() is now a flags option which
      takes NS_COOKIE_SECURE and NS_COOKIE_SCRIPTABLE. Non-scriptable is the
      default as for the Tcl API.

    * ns_var, ns_share and the -share option to ns_set have been removed.
      Please use the nsv_* commands instead.


Configuration Changes:

    Please update your server configuration files to take account of the
    following new features and changes.

    * Fastpath static page configuration is now a global setting rather then
      per-server:

      ns_section "ns/fastpath"
      ns_param mmap          flase    ;# Use mmap(2) to read files from disk.
      ns_param cache         false    ;# Cache file contents in memory.
      ns_param cachemaxsize  10240000 ;# Size of file cache, if enabled.
      ns_param cachemaxentry 8192     ;# Don't cache files larger than this.

    * Global thread stacksize configuration deprecated. Server now uses OS
      default. Only explicitly set the stacksize to some smaller than default
      value if you need to save memory because your server has a lot of
      threads, and you know for certain this won't cause problems with deeply
      nested Tcl or ADP scripts.

      ns_section "ns/parameters"      ;# or "ns/threads"
      ns_param stacksize     100000   ;# DON'T DO THIS.

    * The dnscachemaxentries config param has been renamed dnscachemaxsize to
      more accurately reflect what the setting does. A new setting
      dnswaittimeout has been added:

      ns_section "ns/parameters"
      ns_param dnscache        true   ;# Enable the DNS query cache.
      ns_param dnscachemaxsize 512000 ;# Max memory for cache.
      ns_param dnscachetimeout 60     ;# Minutes to cache a DNS query.
      ns_param dnstimeout      5      ;# Seconds to wait for query answer.

    * The buffer size used by the writer thread is now configurable:

      ns_section "ns/server/server1/module/nssock"
      ns_param writerbufsize   8192   ;# Read from file in bufsize chunks.

    * The Tcl lazy loader may be enabled with the following parameter:

      ns_section "ns/server/server1/tcl"
      ns_param lazyloader      false  ;# Define procs in thread-interps on
      demand.

    * New sections for server limits:

      ns_section "ns/limits"
      ns_param default         "Default Limits" ;# Defines a limit.

      ns_section "ns/limit/default"
      ns_param maxrun          100       ;# Conn threads running for limit.
      ns_param maxwait         100       ;# Conn threads waiting for limit.
      ns_param maxupload       102400000 ;# Max size of file upload in bytes.
      ns_param timeout         60        ;# Total seconds to wait for resources.

      ns_section "ns/server/server1/limits"
      ns_param default         "GET  /*" ;# Map default limit to URL.
      ns_param default         "POST /*"
      ns_param default         "HEAD /*"


Code Changes:

   * Nsv shared variables now have a C API.

   * Experimental event driven IO API, Ns_Event*().

   * New Ns_RegisterAtShutdown() proc handles notification of shutdown and
     wait for completion with timeout.

   * Make Ns_RegisterProxy() public, add ns_register_proxy command.

   * Vectored IO support:

       Ns_ConnSend() now sends all given buffers. Used to send 16 and silently
       discard the rest.

       Increase max iov buffs sent at once.

       Expose iov functionality to higher layers with Ns_ConnWriteVChars(),
       which handles character data, and Ns_ConnWriteV(), which manages data
       streaming.

       ns_write now takes a vector of buffers.

   * New driver callback API. This affects modules such as nssock and any SSL
     modules. This provides more flexibility to write unusual protocol modules.
     Also added is the ability to provide platform-specific sendfile() support.

   * Each loaded driver module now runs in it's own thread (port from
     AOLserver 4.5).

   * Use *DStingSetLength() rather than *DStringTrunc() throughout code to try
     and prevent excess malloc/free activity.

   * Conn structure now contains stat with the file currently being served, stat is
     called at the beginning of the request

   The following routines have been removed, deprecated or disabled.

   * Removed: Ns_RegisterServerShutdown(), Ns_RegisterAtServerShutdown(),
     Ns_RegisterShutdown().
     See: Ns_RegisterAtShutdown().
   * Disabled: Ns_LogSetLogFlushProc(), Ns_SetNsLogProc().
     See: Ns_AddLogfilter(), Ns_RemoveLofFilter().


   IMPORTANT API changes: (length, nsend) parameters are now Tcl_WideInt, so it requires
   to recompile all modules that use those functions:
        
        int Ns_ConnSendChannel(Ns_Conn *conn, Tcl_Channel chan, Tcl_WideInt nsend)
        int Ns_ConnSendFp(Ns_Conn *conn, FILE *fp, Tcl_WideInt nsend)
        int Ns_ConnSendFd(Ns_Conn *conn, int fd, Tcl_WideInt nsend)
        
        void Ns_ConnSetRequiredHeaders(Ns_Conn *conn, CONST char *type, Tcl_WideInt length)
        void Ns_ConnSetLengthHeader(Ns_Conn *conn, Tcl_WideInt length)
        int Ns_ConnReturnOpenChannel(Ns_Conn *conn, int status, CONST char *type,
                         Tcl_Channel chan, Tcl_WideInt length)
        int Ns_ConnReturnOpenFile(Ns_Conn *conn, int status, CONST char *type,
                      FILE *fp, Tcl_WideInt length)
        int Ns_ConnReturnOpenFd(Ns_Conn *conn, int status, CONST char *type,
                    int fd, Tcl_WideInt length)
