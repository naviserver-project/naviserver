# Things to remember when writing man pages
#

This README file is an initial attempt to provide a guideline on how to
structure and how to use the markup options of dtplite for the
naviserver documentation. It took me always quite a long time how to
figure one could or should to use dtplite so i starte writing this.
Judging from the different usage pattern in the documentation, i guess
others had similar problems. 

However this is just a first start and is aimed to provide
best-practice examples.

Structure:
==========

- Begin of man page
- [section COMMANDS]
- [section OPTIONS]
- [section EXAMPLES]
- [section CONFIGURATION]
- End of man page


Begin of a man page:

[manpage_begin ns_cache n [vset version]]
[moddesc   {NaviServer Built-In Commands}]
[titledesc {Cache manipulation}]

... general description ...

Sample definition of a command:
===============================

[call [cmd ns_xxxx] \
        [opt [option "-contents"]] \
        [opt [option "-reset"]] \
	[opt [option "-status [arg status]"]] \
        [opt [arg --]] \
        [arg name] ]

References in the text:

End of the man page:
====================
