[description]

 The [cmd ns_auth] command provides access to NaviServerâ€™s pluggable
 authorization framework.  It dispatches calls through the chain of
 registered authorization handlers, allowing user-provided C or Tcl
 callbacks to grant, deny, or challenge requests at both the URL and
 user/password level.

[para]
 Before using [cmd ns_auth], one or more authorization callbacks must be registered
 (e.g. via the [uri ./ns_register.html#2 ns_register_auth] Tcl API
 or the [term nsperm] module).
 See the [uri ../../nsperm/files/nsperm.html \
   "nsperm - NaviServer Permissions and Access Control Guide"]
 for an example of how to configure and register nsperm handlers.

[section COMMANDS]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd "ns_auth request"] \
	[opt [option -dict]] \
	[opt --] \
        [arg method] \
        [arg url] \
        [arg username] \
        [arg password] \
        [opt [arg ipaddr]] \
        ]

 Performs a full request-level permission check exactly as done by
 NaviServer before serving a URL.  The callbacks registered for
 "request" authorization are invoked in order, each receiving
 [arg method],  [arg url],  [arg authuser],  [arg authpasswd]
 and optional  [arg ipaddr].  By default, the command returns one of
 the following status codes:

[list_begin itemized]
[item] OK            - access granted
[item] ERROR         - internal error during authorization
[item] FORBIDDEN     - access denied, no possible retry
[item] UNAUTHORIZED  - authentication required or failed, retry possible
[item] FILTER_RETURN - authorization chain intentionally stopped
[list_end]

[para]
If the [option -dict] flag is given, the result is returned as a dictionary:

[example_begin]
  { authority <authority> code <code> }
[example_end]

where [const <authority>] is the label of the handler that last ran, and
[const <status>] is the same status code as shown above.


[call [cmd "ns_auth user"] \
      [opt [option -dict]] \
      [opt --] \
      [arg username] \
      [arg password] \
]

Runs the user-level authorization handlers in order to verify only
a [arg username] and [arg password] pair (with no URL context).
Results and options are the same as for [cmd "ns_auth request"].
