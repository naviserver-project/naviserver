[titledesc {Low level cryptographic functions based on the OpenSSL crypto library}]

[description]

These functions perform low-level cryptographic functions based on the
OpenSSL crypto library. These commands are only implemented when
NaviServer was compiled with OpenSSL support. The level of support
depends on the version of OpenSSL. Versions earlier than OpenSSL 1.0
are not supported.

[para]
For some higher level
functions (e.g. performing e.g. digest or HMAC operations of huge
amounts of data) see e.g.[cmd ns_md] and [cmd ns_hmac].

[para]
Note: some common options are described in a separate section below.

[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]


[call [cmd "ns_crypto::aead::encrypt string"] \
     [opt [option -binary]] \
     [opt [option "-aad [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-cipher [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-encoding hex|base64url|base64|binary"]] \
     [opt [option "-iv [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-key [arg value]"]] \
     [opt --] \
     [arg input]]

[para] encrypt data following the Authenticated Encryption with
Associated Data (AEAD) scheme, which provides confidentiality,
integrity, and authenticity. Currently, only GCM mode (Galois/Counter
Mode) is supported. For details about AEAD in GCM mode, see,
e.g., [uri https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf].

[para]
AEAD has the following properties:

[list_begin definitions]
[def Secrecy] Nobody will be able to get any information about the
     encrypted plaintext, except the length.
[def Authenticity] Without the key it is impossible to change the
     plaintext underlying the ciphertext undetected.
[def Symmetric] Encrypting the message and decrypting the ciphertext
     is done with the same key.
[def Randomization] The encryption is randomized. Two messages with
     the same plaintext will not yield the same ciphertext. This prevents
     attackers from knowing which ciphertext corresponds to a given
     plaintext.
[list_end]

[para] The function returns a dict consisting of [term bytes] and the
authentication [term tag] used for decryption.

[para] The option [option "-aad"] can be used to specify
Additional Authenticated Data (AAD), which is data handled by
encryption, which is sent in clear text. The encryption still provides
authenticity for AAD. AAD can be used e.g. for addresses, ports,
sequence numbers, protocol version numbers.

[para] The option [option "-cipher"] can be used to
specify the used cipher such as e.g. [term aes-128-gcm] (default) or
[term aes-256-gcm]. Possible values are defined by OpenSSL.

[para] The option [option "-iv"] specifies the
initialization vector (IV) for encryption. IV is essentially a nonce
value, a value that is unique within the specified context (see the
NIST publication for details).

[para] The option [option "-key"] specifies the key for the
encryption.

[para] The argument [arg input] is the data to be encrypted.

[para] When the option [option -binary] is specified, it applies to
[option -key], [option -aad], [option -iv], [arg input].

[example_begin]
 % ns_crypto::aead::encrypt string -cipher aes-128-gcm -iv 123456789 -key secret "hello world"
 bytes fa260f97eae35e3e3df0b7 tag 93654f78fd189b559c091acb410a0040
[example_end]

[call [cmd "ns_crypto::aead::decrypt string"] \
     [opt [option -binary]] \
     [opt [option "-aad [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-cipher [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-encoding hex|base64url|base64|binary"]] \
     [opt [option "-iv [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-key [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-tag [arg value]"]] \
     [opt --] \
     [arg input]]

This function implements the inverse function of
[cmd "ns_crypto::aead::encrypt string"]. Note that the resulting
[term tag] of the encryption result is used as an input for decryption.
The result is a byte string of the decrypted input (no dict).

[para] When the option [option -binary] is specified, it applies to
[option -key], [option -aad], [option -iv], and [option -tag].
The argument [arg input] (the cipher text) is always treated as byte array.

[example_begin]
 % set d [lb]ns_crypto::aead::encrypt string -cipher aes-128-gcm -iv 123456789 \
    -key secret -encoding binary \
    "hello world"[rb]
 % ns_crypto::aead::decrypt string -cipher aes-128-gcm -iv 123456789 \
    -key secret -tag [lb]dict get $d tag[rb] \
    -encoding binary [lb]dict get $d bytes[rb]
[example_end]



[call [cmd "ns_crypto::argon2"] \
     [opt [option "-ad [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-binary"]] \
     [opt [option "-encoding hex|base64url|base64|binary"]] \
     [opt [option "-iter [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-lanes [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-memcost [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-outlen [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-password [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-salt [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-secret [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-threads [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-variant [arg value]"]] \
]

Computes a password hash or a derived key based on the Argon2 family
of functions (RFC 9106, published in 2021) and return the hash (named
"tag" in the RFC) in the specified encoding (default hex).

[para] Argon2 is a modern replacement for crypt and bcrypt and derives
more secret keys from a secret string. Argon2 was selected as the
winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition and is the recommended
password hashing algorithm of the OWASP project.

The algorithm is defined in 3 different variants, named [term Argon2d]
(providing resistance GPU cracking attacks), [term Argon2i] (resist
side-channel attacks) and [term Argon2id] (hybrid version, based on [term Argon2d]
and [term Argon2i]).

[para] Argon2 has several parameters to provide control over execution time,
required memory, and degree of parallelism to tailor security
requirements of a site, to provide high security against modern
password cracking hardware.

The function requires the compilation of NaviServer against
OpenSSL 3.2 or newer. The names of the parameters correspond to the
names of the parameters provided for the C-level API, so additional
information can be obtained from the OpenSSL documentation.

[para] When the option [option -binary] is specified, it applies to
the input parameters [option -ad], [option -password], [option -salt],
and [option -secret].

[para] The required option [option "-salt"] must be at least 8 bytes.

[para] The option [option "-iter"] can be used to specify the number
of iterations of the algorithm (sometimes named "passes"). The default
value is 3.

[para] The option [option "-lanes"] can be used to specify the number
of memory segments that can be processed in parallel. The number of
used threads depends on the [option "-threads"] parameter. The
provided value influences the result. The default value of "lanes" is
1.

[para] The option [option "-memcost"] can be used to specify the
memory cost specified in 1 KB blocks. The default value is
1024 (i.e. 1 MB).

[para] The option [option "-outlen"] can be used to specify the
length of the resulting tag in bytes. The default value is 64.

[para] The option [option "-secret"] can be used to specify an
additional secret (sometimes called pepper) to be used an optional
secret data used along the password.

[para] The option [option "-threads"] can be used to specify the
number of threads for the computation of the lanes. The provided value
does not influence the result, but just the duration of the command.
The default value is 1.

[para] The option [option "-variant"] can be used to specify the
variant of the command.  The default value is "Argon2id".

[call [cmd "ns_crypto::eckey generate"] \
     [opt [option "-name [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-pem [arg value]"]] \
     ]

Generate an EC pemfile without the need of an external command.
If no [option -name] is provided (name of the elliptic curve),
[term prime256v1] is assumed. An other popular candidate is
[term secp384r1]. The [option "-pem"] denotes the name
of the output file, which is in PEM format.

[para]
This function requires OpenSSL compiled with EC support enabled.

[example_begin]

     [opt [option "-pem [arg value]"]] \
     [opt --] \
     [arg pubkey]]

Generate a shared secret based on the private key from the .pem file
and the provided public key. It is possible to provide the filename
of the PEM file or its content as a string. When the .pem file is
secured by a passphrase, this has to be provided via
[option "-passphrase"].

[para] When the option [option -binary] is specified, it applies to
[arg pubkey].

[para] This function requires OpenSSL 1.1 or newer, compiled with EC
support enabled.

     [opt [option "-passphrase [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-pem [arg value]"]] \
    ]

Obtain the public key in various encodings from an elliptic curves PEM
file. It is possible to provide the filename of the PEM file or its
content as a string. When the .pem file is secured by a passphrase, this has to be
provided via [option "-passphrase"].

     [arg key] \
     [arg message]]

Return a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) for the
specified [arg key] and [arg message] using the specified message
digest algorithm and return it in the specified encoding. An HMAC is
a message authentication code of a key (secret) with a message. It may
be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the
authentication of a message. For details of HMAC, consult RFC 4231.

[para]
When the option [option -binary] is specified, it applies to
[arg key] and [arg message].

[example_begin]
 % ns_hmac string -digest sha256 "Jefe" "what do ya want for nothing?"
 5bdcc146bf60754e6a042426089575c75a003f089d2739839dec58b964ec3843
[example_end]

[para] This low-level function operates just on an input string (which has to
be in memory). In order to compute HMACs on large data, use
[cmd ns_hmac].


[call [cmd "ns_crypto::md string"] \
     [opt [option "-digest [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-encoding hex|base64url|base64|binary"]] \

     [opt [option -binary]] \
     [arg message]]

[para] Return a message digest for the provided [arg message] and
return it in the specified encoding. Optionally, this function can
return a signature based on the provided private key, or it can
verify such a signature.

 b381e7fec653fc3ab9b178272366b8ac87fed8d31cb25ed1d0e1f3318644c89c
[example_end]

[para] This low-level function operates just on an input string (which
has to be in memory). In order to compute digests on large data (such
as from files), use [cmd ns_md].

[para] The [cmd "ns_crypto::md string"] interface can be as well used
for digital signing and verification of the signature, when the
respective keys are passed in as PEM files. When the PEM file is secured
by a passphrase, the option [option "-passphrase [arg ...]"] has
to be used to decipher the key.

[para] The option [option "-sign [arg pemfile]"] is used to sign
the given message. It is possible to provide the filename of the PEM file or its
content as a string.

[para] The options [option "-verify [arg pemfile]"] and
[option "-signature [arg signatureString]"] can be used to
verify a signature using the private key from provided PEM file.
It is possible to provide the filename of the PEM file or its
content as a string.
The [arg signatureString] is required to be a binary string,
therefore, produced with the output option [option "-encoding binary"]
in the example below:

[example_begin]
 % set sig [lb]::ns_crypto::md string \
 	     -digest sha1 \
 	     -encoding binary \
 	     -sign /usr/local/src/naviserver/myprivate.pem \

     [opt [option "-r [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-encoding hex|base64url|base64|binary"]] \
     ]

Computes a password hash based on the scrypt Password-Based Key
Derivation Function (RFC 7914) and return the specified number of
random bytes in the specified encoding (default [term hex]).

[para]
The scrypt function is a modern replacement for crypt and bcrypt and
derives more secret keys from a secret string.  It is based on memory-hard
functions, which offer added protection against attacks using custom hardware
and GPU arrays. The function requires the compilation of NaviServer against
OpenSSL 3.0 or newer.

[para]
The scrypt function is as well used in many cryptocurrencies as a
proof-of-work algorithm.

     [opt [option "-dklen [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-iterations [arg integer]"]] \
     [opt [option "-salt [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-secret [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-encoding hex|base64url|base64|binary"]] \
     ]

Computes a password hash based on PBKDF2 (Password-Based
Key Derivation Function 2, RFC 2898) in the length of [arg nrbtyes].
This function is used to reduce
vulnerabilities of brute-force attacks against password hashes and is
used, e.g., in SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication
Mechanism). It can be used e.g. for SCRAM-sha1 and SCRAM-sha-256.
The hash function of SCRAM is PBKDF2 (RFC2898) with HMAC as the
pseudorandom function (PRF) and with dkLen == output length of
HMAC == output length of the digest function.

[para]
The function requires at least OpenSSL 1.1.1.

[para]
When the option [option -binary] is specified, it applies to
[option -salt] and [option -secret].

[para]
The option [option -dklen] specifies the length of the output key and
is by default the same as the output length of the used digest.

[para]
The option [option -iterations] specifies the number of iterations
(repeated HMAC operations) and defaults to 4096. RFC 7677 recommends
15K iterations.

[example_begin]
 % ::ns_crypto::pbkdf2_hmac -secret "password" -iterations 4096 -salt "salt" -digest sha1
 4b007901b765489abead49d926f721d065a429c1
 
 % time {::ns_crypto::pbkdf2_hmac -secret "pass\0word" -iterations 15000 -salt "sa\0lt" -dklen 16}
 16027 microseconds per iteration
[example_end]


[call [cmd "ns_crypto::uuid"] \
        [opt [option "-version v4|v7"]]]

 Returns a newly generated UUID string in canonical textual form
 "8-4-4-4-12" (36 lowercase hexadecimal characters plus 4
 hyphens). The result is always NUL-free ASCII suitable for storage in
 CHAR(36), VARCHAR(36), or database UUID types.

[para]

 If no [option "-version"] is specified, the command returns a Version
 4 (UUIDv4) identifier for backward compatibility with the historical
 [cmd ns_uuid] command. UUIDv4 values are generated from cryptographic
 random bytes and include no timestamp information, providing maximum
 entropy and privacy without revealing creation time.  (UUIDv4 is
 specified in [uri \
        https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122 "RFC 4122"])

[para]

 When [option "-version v7"] is specified, the command returns a
 Version 7 (UUIDv7) identifier as defined in [uri \
     https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9562 "RFC 9562"].

 UUIDv7 values embed the current time in milliseconds in the
 high-order bits and random data in the remaining bits. They are
 globally unique and monotonically increasing with creation time,
 which improves index locality and insertion performance in databases
 and ordered data stores. However, UUIDv7 values encode their creation
 time, so they can reveal when an ID was generated.

[example_begin]
 % ns_crypto::uuid
 3191eb43-60a3-4c9b-a3dc-9b5ef667641b
 
 % ns_crypto::uuid -version v4
 75a2d2a1-7d67-4d59-8a2f-8e4f0eba4b36
 
 % ns_crypto::uuid -version v7
 018fa74a-9f4c-7d82-9a5f-b59e22f14d35
[example_end]

 The built-in historical command [cmd ns_uuid] is equivalent to
 [cmd {ns_crypto::uuid -version v4}] and is retained for backward
 compatibility with existing applications and persisted identifiers.

[opt_def -encoding hex|base64url|base64|binary]

[para] The option [option "-encoding"] specifies the
output encoding used for the resulting values of the dict.
Possible encodings are [term hex], [term base64url],
[term base64], or [term binary]. Default is [term hex].

[opt_def -binary]

[para]
When the option [option -binary] is used, the mentioned input
arguments are treated as binary. The Tcl byte array value
of the provided input argument is used and no UTF-8 interpretation
is performed. When the type of the Tcl value is clearly a binary type
(pure/proper byte array) then it is not necessary to use
[option -binary] explicitly.
