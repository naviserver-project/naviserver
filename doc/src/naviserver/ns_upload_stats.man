[titledesc {Return real-time statistic about being uploaded file}]

[description]
This command is useful in case of uploading big files and giving users some
progress statistics about the process. It works by creating special counter for
the uploaded url and keeps updating it while the file is being uploaded. Once
file is uploaded completely these statistics are removed from the local cache.
