[titledesc {Make a unique temporary filename}]

[description] This command is a wrapper around the mktemp(3) function
in the C standard library.  This function generates a unique temporary
filename from an optional template.  

[para]
Note that some implementations of mktemp are not safe (creating
predictable/only a small number of variations) against attacks and
race conditions - please consult your 
system's man pages if this might be an issue to you. In order to create
temp files, the Tcl command [term "file tempfile"] should be used
(introduced in Tcl 8.6), which is safe against race conditions.

[para]
For creating temporary directories, use [cmd ns_mkdtemp].

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd ns_mktemp] [opt [arg template]]]

[para]

This command generates a unique temporary filename using optionally a
template as argument, which is a string whose last six characters must
be XXXXXX, and returns a new string where those are replaced with
random characters such as to make the string a unique filename. It is
commonly used to create temporary filenames.

[para]
If this command is called without the optional parameter it behaves
like
[example_begin]
 ns_mktemp [lb]ns_config ns/parameters tmpdir[rb]/ns-XXXXXX
[example_end]


[list_end]
