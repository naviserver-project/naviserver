[titledesc {Return a complete HTTP status message}]

[description]

These commands return a complete response to the client using a variety of
different HTTP status codes. On contrary to the lower level commands
like [cmd ns_return] these commands are designed to ease consistent
behavior in common success, redirect or error situations.

Like with [cmd ns_return] all queued headers, such as those set by
[cmd ns_setcookie] (see [cmd ns_cookie]) or via [cmd "ns_conn"] [cmd "outputheaders"] and 
[cmd "ns_set put"], are added to the default headers and sent in the response.

[para]
These commands return 0 (zero) if the response was successfully
sent to the client and 1 if the write to the connection failed.
They will raise an error if no connection is available, e.g. they are called from
a non-connection thread or the response has already been sent and the connection
closed.

[para]
After the command returns the connection is returned to the driver thread to be
closed or monitored for keep-alive. The calling connection thread can then
continue to execute code, e.g. to cleanup resources or for logging.

[para]
Custom error pages may be specified in the server configuration file to
override the default HTML message which is returned, for those commands which
return one.

[para]
NOTE: The script does not end at the time these commands are invoked.
When used in an ADP page, [cmd ns_adp_abort] or [cmd ns_adp_return]
should be called to end script processing after ns_returnredirect. 


[section COMMANDS]
[list_begin definitions]


[call [cmd ns_returnok] ]

Return a response with status code [term 200], [term OK]. No body content is
sent.



[call [cmd ns_returnmoved] \
        [arg url] ]

Return a response with status code [term 301], [term Moved]. A [term Location]
header will be set with the given [arg url].

[para]
Use this response to signal that the resource identified by the requested URL
has permanently moved to a new location. The client should request the new URL
instead of the old one in the future.


[call [cmd ns_returnredirect] \
        [arg url] ]

Return a response with status code [term 302], [term Found]. The [term Location]
header will be set to the [arg url] if given. For non-fully qualified
target addresses, the URL is completed with either the location
configured via [cmd ns_locationproc] or via the [term location] configured in the
network driver module (see [cmd nssock]).

[para]
Use this response to signal that the resource identified by the requested URL has
temporarily moved to a new location. The client should continue to request the
old URL.


[call [cmd ns_returnbadrequest] \
        [arg reason] ]

Return a response with status code [term 400], [term "Bad Request"] using the
given [arg reason] in the HTML message.

[para]
Use this response to signal that the client sent a malformed request and should
not try again without modifications.



[call [cmd ns_returnunauthorized] ]

Return a response with status code [term 401], [term "Access Denied"]. A
[term WWW-Authenticate] header will be set using the [term realm] specified
in the configuration file option [term ns/server:realm].

[para]
Use this response to signal that the user is not authorized to access the URL,
and to trigger [term "HTTP basic"] authorization. The client may present
a pop-up window for the user to enter their [term username] and [term password].

[para]
NB: The username and password will be sent in plain text.



[call [cmd ns_returnforbidden] ]

Return a response with status code [term 403], [term Forbidden].

[para]
Use this response to signal that the authentication information the client
supplied are insufficient to grant them access to the requested URL.

[call [cmd ns_returnnotfound] ]

Return a response with status code [term 404], [term "Not Found"].

[para]
Use this response to signal that the content the client requested could not be
located given the URL that was requested.



[call [cmd ns_returnunavailable] ]

Return a response with status code [term 503], [term "Unavailable"].

[para]
Use this response to signal that the server is too busy to deliver the requested
resource or is undergoing maintenance.



[call [cmd ns_returnerror] \
        [arg status] \
        [arg message] ]

Return a response with the given [arg status] code and the error [arg message]
wrapped in HTML.

[para]
Use this command to return an HTTP status response to the client which is not
covered by the above commands, or to customize the HTML message.



[call [cmd ns_returnnotice] \
        [arg status] \
        [arg title] \
        [arg message] ]

Return a response with the given [arg status] code and an HTML message with the
given [arg title] and [arg message].

[para]
Use this command to return an arbitrary response to the client. Some HTTP
responses are expected not to return body content. Check RFC 2616 for details.

[para]
NB: You should be careful what you put in the [arg title] and [arg message].
It may be tempting to use data which the client has sent you such as a form
variable, but it may not be what you expect.

[list_end]


[para] Note: The script does not end at the time this command is
invoked. [cmd ns_adp_abort] or ]cmd ns_adp_return] should be called to
end script processing after ns_returnforbidden.

[section CONFIGURATION]

The body of the response which is returned for a variety of status codes can be
customized by registering a new resource which should be returned in its place.
The new resource may be a static, Tcl or ADP page, or a registered procedure
or ADP. These redirects are used for providing customized (templated)
error pages.

[example_begin]
 [cmd ns_section] "ns/server/server1/redirects" {
   [cmd ns_param]   404    /notfound.adp
   [cmd ns_param]   503    /busy.html
 }
[example_end]

[para]
The realm used for HTTP Basic authentication is set server-wide:

[example_begin]
 [cmd ns_section] "ns/server" {
   [cmd ns_param]   realm  "Example"
 }
[example_end]



[section EXAMPLES]

Use a custom error message to notify users when the hamsters which turn the
wheels that run the server are on lunch break:

[example_begin]
 ns_register_proc GET /service {
 
   set hour [lb]clock format [lb]clock seconds[rb] -format %H[rb]
 
   if {$hour >= 12 && $hour <= 13} {
      ns_returnerror 503 "Gone for lunch. Back at 2pm."
      return
   }
 
   [cmd ns_returnok]
 }
[example_end]
