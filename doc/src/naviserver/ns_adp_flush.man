[call [cmd ns_adp_flush]]

This command flushes the ADP output buffer (i.e. sends the current
content to the browser or writes to the file channel and truncates the
buffer). It will raise a Tcl exception if the underlying flush failed,
for example, if the HTTP connection is closed or the channel write
failed. 
[para]
Flushed content is returned in "chunked-encoding" format if
the HTTP protocol version is at least 1.1 (normally the case for all
modern browsers). A call to ns_adp_flush is not normally needed except
for specialized applications as all content is automatically flushed
at the end of a connection or on buffer overflow. See [cmd ns_adp_ctl]
bufsize for details on buffer management.
