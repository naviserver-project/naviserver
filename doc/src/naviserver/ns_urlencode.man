[titledesc {Encode a string to its URL-encoded representation}]

[description]

 This command encodes a string according to the rules for URL encoding
 defined in RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), (or RFC 1738,
 when NaviServer was configured to use this older standard).

 ns_urlencode codes essentially all non-alphanumeric characters in the
 specified components.  The epcial octets are encoded by a "%"
 followed by the two-character hexa- decimal representation for the
 octet.

[section {COMMANDS}]

[list_begin definitions]

 [call [cmd ns_urlencode] \
     [opt [option "-charset [arg value]"]] \
     [opt [option "-part query|path|cookie|oauth1"]] \
     [opt [option "-uppercase"]] \
     [opt --] \
     [arg "component ..."]]

[list_end]

The option [option -charset] can be used to specify the character set
of the encode operation. Option [arg part] is used to specify the type
of encoding. The most common uses are [term query] or [term path],
indicating that query components or path components are to be encoded.
Multiple query components are concatenated via [term &], in the path
components with [term /].

[para] The part argument can be as well used for additional percent
encodings such as the cookie encoding (value [term cookie], RFC 6265) or
the oauth1 encoding (value [term oauth1]) as defined in RFC 5849 Section
3.6 for the construction of the signature base string and the
[term Authorization] header field.

[para] The default for option [option -charset] is [term query].

[section {EXAMPLES}]

The following example encodes the Tcl dict as
[term application/x-www-form-urlencoded] POST data
([uri https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4])

[example_begin]
 set data {
   first_name  John
   second_name Doe
   data        "Hello World"
 }
 
 set post_data {}
 foreach {key value} $data {
     lappend post_data "[lb]ns_urlencode -part query $key[rb]=[lb]ns_urlencode $value[rb]"
 }
 set post_data [lb]join $post_data &[rb]
[example_end]

The second example shows encodings of path segments based on example 1
and 2 of [uri https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html]

[example_begin]
 % set e1 {albert bertram marie-claude}
 % ns_urlencode -part path {*}$e1
 albert/bertram/marie-claude
 
 % set e2 {albert bertram/marie-claude}
 % ns_urlencode -part path {*}$e2
 albert/bertram%2fmarie-claude
