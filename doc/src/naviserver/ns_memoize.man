[titledesc {Evaluate a Tcl script and cache the result}]

[description]

A simple wrapper around [cmd ns_cache_eval] which uses the script to be
evaluated as the key to the cached result of evaluating the script. Use this
when evaluating the script could take some time.

[para]
If the script is not pure, i.e. if it depends on something other than its
arguments to compute the result, then you will need to supply an expiry
time or explicitly flush the result when the dependency changes.


[section COMMANDS]
[list_begin definitions]


[call [cmd ns_memoize] \
     [opt [option "-timeout [arg time]"]] \
     [opt [option "-expires [arg time ]"]] \
     [opt --] \
     [arg script] \
     [opt [arg "arg ..."]] ]

Evaluate [arg script] and [arg args] and return the result. The result is
cached so that future evaluations of the same [arg script] and [arg args] will
return the cached result without first evaluating the script.

[para] 
The script result remains valid until the supplied expire time
passes, or forever if not specified. The value for 
[option -expires] 
can be expressed either as an absolute time in the
future (large values are interpreted as seconds since the Unix epoch), 
or as an offset from the current time.

[para]
If two threads execute the same [arg script] and [arg args], one will wait for
the other to compute the result and store it in the cache. The [option -timeout] 
option specifies how long to wait.


[call [cmd ns_memoize_flush] [opt [arg pattern]]]

Flush results from the memoize cache. If a [arg pattern] is not given, all
results are discarded. If a [arg pattern] is given it is treated as a
[term globbing] pattern and matched against each script for which there is
a cached result in turn, and those that match are discarded.

[para]
Note: this may be an expensive operation. First the cache lock is acquired,
then all entries in the cache are iterated over in turn matching the script
against the globbing pattern.  During this period all access to the memoize
cache will be blocked.


[call [cmd ns_memoize_stats]]

Return a list of statistics about the effectiveness of the memoize cache. Use
this information to help you tune the cache size. See [cmd ns_cache_stats]
for details of the format of this list.

[section EXAMPLES]

For the next three quarters of an hour, the answer to the "meaning of life"
will take no time at all to decide:

[example_begin]
 set answer [lb][cmd ns_memoize] -expires 2520 deep_thought "meaning of life"[rb]
[example_end]


Flush the cache of all thoughts which are deep:

[example_begin]
 [cmd ns_memoize_flush] deep_*
[example_end]
