[call [cmd ns_strcoll] \
        [opt [option "-locale [arg locale]"]] \
        [arg string1] \
        [arg string2]]

[para] This command compares lexicographically string1 with string2
  according to the current locale collation and returns an integer
  greater than, equal to, or less than 0, depending on whether string1
  is greater than, equal to, or less than string2. The command is
  necessary in cases, where e.g. the sorting order from the database
  (normally based on local collation) is different from default Tcl
  sorting order to provide a uniform interface with same sorting
  orders. The name of the function is derived from the baseline POSIX
  function call.

[para] When the option [option "-locale"] is not set, the LC_COLLATE
value is determined by the operating system (looking into the settings
of LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE and LANG). When locale is specified, it is
recommended to use the specification consisting of language, territory
and charset (e.g. [term en_US.UTF-8].

[para] Note that the output of the command depends on correct
installation of locales on the host. Furthermore, the output of the
command varies depending on the C library's implementation. Some
implementations support further advanced sorting features such as
case-folding collation, ignoring preceding dashes etc. especially for
UTF-8 locales, other implementations don't. Future versions of the
function might consider using the ICU library (International
Components for Unicode) for further cross-platform compatibility.

[section EXAMPLES]

[para]
The command is suitable for usage in the Tcl lsort command:

[example_begin]
 % set l {Bor Bar B채r}
 % lsort -command ns_strcoll $l
 Bar B채r Bor
 
 % lsort $l
 Bar Bor B채r 

 % lsort -command {ns_strcoll -locale en_US.UTF-8} $l
 Bar B채r Bor
