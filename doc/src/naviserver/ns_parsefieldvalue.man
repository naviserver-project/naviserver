[call [cmd ns_parsefieldvalue] \
     [opt [option "-lower"]] \
     [opt [option "-single"]] \
     [opt [option "-strict"]] \
     [opt --] \
     [arg fieldvalue]]

[para] This function parses the provided field value (from an HTTP
request or reply header field) into its parts and returns these in the
form of a list of Tcl dicts or a single Tcl dict, when
[option "-single"] was specified. The syntax for the contents of
these header fields is specified in RFC 7230 section 3.2.6.

[para] Per default, the command assumes a comma separated list of
elements, where every element might consist of multiple parts
separated by a semicolon. When the [option "-lower"] is specified, the
keys of the returned dicts are converted to lowercase.  When the
[option "-single"] is specified, only the first element of the
(potentially) comma separated list of elements is returned. When
[option "-strict"] is specified, then the command is expected to parse
the full string, otherwise it will just parse as far as possible (when
e.g. [option "-single"] is used.
