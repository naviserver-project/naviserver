[titledesc {Stop processing of the current ADP and return up the call stack}]

[description]

 This command ends processing of the current ADP and returns up the call stack,
 possibly to a previous ADP that had included the current one.  Returns retval
 or an empty string by default.

 Note that this command returns only one level up the call stack.  To return
 all the way up the call stack, use ns_adp_break.
