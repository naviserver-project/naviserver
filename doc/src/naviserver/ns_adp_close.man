[call [cmd ns_adp_close]]

This command flushes the ADP output buffer (i.e. sends it to the
browser) and closes the underlying HTTP connection. ADP execution
continues after the connection is closed. Any text appended to the ADP
output buffer after the close is simply discarded when processing is
complete.
