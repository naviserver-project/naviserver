[titledesc {Binary-to-text encoding using "htuu" encoding}]

[description]

 This command performs a binary-to-text encoding on string.  The
 encoded string will be approximately 33% longer than the original by
 using he base64 encoding scheme. The command is kept
 for backward compatibility, the command [cmd ns_base64encode]
 should be used instead.

[para]
 NOTE: This type of encoding is sometimes called "htuu". This
 command converts the specified argument to RFC 1113 printable
 encoding format. This technique is similar to the familiar Unix
 uuencode format in that it maps 6 binary bits to one ASCII character
 (or more aptly, 3 binary bytes to 4 ASCII characters). However, RFC
 1113 does not use the same mapping to printable characters as
 uuencode.

[list_begin definitions]

 [call [cmd ns_uuencode] \
 	[opt [option -binary]] \
	[opt [option --]] \
	[arg string]]

When the option [option -binary] is used, the Tcl byte array value
of the provided input argument is used and no UTF-8 interpretation
is performed.
