[para] Convert from memory units or from time units to its
  base value using the NaviServer internal converters,
  which are used the same way for various commands.
  The base unit for a memory size is a byte,
  for a time value a second). This command os necessary to
  provide Tcl-level commands calculating with these
  units to support uniform interfaces (e.g. calculating
  cache partition sizes base on values such as 2MB).

[para] Either [option "-size [arg size]"] or
  [option "-time [arg time]"] has to be specified.
  Valid time units are Î¼s, ms, s, m, h, d, w, y.
  Valid size units are kB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB.
