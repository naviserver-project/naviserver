[titledesc {Binary-to-text decoding using "htuu" encoding}]

[description]

 This command performs a text to potentially binary conversion,
 based on the base64 encoding scheme. The command is kept
 for backward compatibility, the command [cmd ns_base64decode]
 should be used instead.

[para]
 NOTE: This stype of encoding is sometimes called "htuu". This command
 converts the specified argument from RFC 1113 printable encoding
 format to its native representation. This technique is similar to the
 familiar Unix uuencode format in that it maps 6 binary bits to one
 ASCII character (or more aptly, 3 binary bytes to 4 ASCII
 characters). However, RFC 1113 does not use the same mapping to
 printable characters as uuencode.

[list_begin definitions]

 [call [cmd ns_uudecode] \
  	[opt [option -binary]] \
        [opt [option -strict]] \
	[opt [option --]] \
	[arg string]]

In case, the result might contain binary content,
it is recommend to use the option [option -binary], which causes the
result to be a Tcl byte array.

[para]
When the option [option -strict] is used, an exception is raised
when in unexpected character is contained in the input. Otherwise
a warning is written to the system log.
