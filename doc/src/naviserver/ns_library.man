[titledesc {Get the paths to the private and shared Tcl libraries}]

[description]

This command returns the path to the private and shared Tcl libraries, optionally specifying a module as well.

library must either be "private" or "shared".  The private library is the same
as what's returned from ns_info tcllib as defined in the config .tcl at server
start-up.  The shared library is relative to the path specified by ns_info home,
in the "modules/tcl" subdirectory.

The optional module is simply concatenated to the path returned from ns_library.
