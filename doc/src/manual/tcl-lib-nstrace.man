[titledesc {Managing TCL interpreter initialization}]

[description]

This file implements set of commands and utilities to manage Tcl interpreter
initialization for NaviServer. What all this stuff does is simple: synthetize
a Tcl script used to initialize new Tcl interpreters.

[para]

There are basically two strategies:

[list_begin itemized]

[item] A. Run an introspective script against an initialized startup interpreter
         and collect definitions of some "known" things: loaded packages, created 
         Tcl procs, namespaces and namespaced variables. Then stuff all this data
         in a (potentially large) script and run this script against virgin Tcl
         interp. This script is obtained by the [lb]nstrace::statescript[rb] command (see below).

[item] B. Register traces on selected Tcl commands and get state they create in a set of
         shared variables (the epoch). Then start bootstraping the interp. This will
         trigger trace callbacks and they will start filling the epoch. After the
         bootstrapping is done, synthetize a script containing minimal fixed state
         (variables, modules) and a definition of [lb]unknown[rb] command which will
         on-demand load procedure definitions out of the epoch state. This script
         is obtained by the [lb]nstrace::tracescript[rb] command (see below).
[list_end]

Which one of the above 2 strategies is currently used by the server, is controlled by
the [emph lazyloader] parameter of the Tcl library, as defined in the server configuration
file. The A. strategy is selected by setting the parameter to false. The B. strategy is
selected by setting the parameter to true.

[para]

In order to influence script generation, users can add their own tracing implementations.
Tracers and other supporting callbacks for the following Tcl commands are provided per default:

[example_begin]
    load, namespace, variable, proc, rename
[example_end]

For the information of how to add new tracers please look into the source code of already provided callbacks.

[list_begin definitions]

[def {nstrace::enabletrace   activates registered Tcl command traces}]

[def {nstrace::disabletrace  terminates tracing of Tcl commands}]
[def {nstrace::tracescript   returns a script for initializing interps}]

[def {nstrace::enablestate   activates generation of the state script}]
[def {nstrace::disablestate  terminates generation of the state script}]
[def {nstrace::statescript   returns a script for initializing interps}]

[def {nstrace::isactive      returns true if tracing Tcl commands is on}]
[def {nstrace::config        setup some configuration options}]

[def {nstrace::excludensp    skip serializing the given namespace}]
[def {nstrace::namespaces    returns list of namespaces for the given parent}]

[def {nstrace::addtrace      registers custom tracer callback}]
[def {nstrace::addscript     registers custom script generator}]
[def {nstrace::addresolver   registers custom command resolver}]

[def {nstrace::enablecode    returns signal about start of tracing}]
[def {nstrace::disablecode   returns signal about stop of tracing}]

[def {nstrace::addentry      adds one entry into the named trace store}]
[def {nstrace::getentry      returns the entry value from the named store}]
[def {nstrace::delentry      removes the entry from the named store}]
[def {nstrace::getentries    returns all entries from the named store}]

[section Limitations]

[list_begin enum]

[enum] [lb]namespace forget[rb] is still not implemented
[enum] [lb]namespace origin cmd[rb] breaks if cmd is not already defined
[enum] [lb]info procs[rb] does not return list of all cached procedures
